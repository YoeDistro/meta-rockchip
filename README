Notes:

  Customize DDR rkbin:
	If you wish to use a different version of DDR binary provided by
	rockchip-rkbin-ddr recipe than the one in this layer, you can create a
	.bbappend in your own layer, and accordingly set SRCREV (possibly
	LIC_FILES_CHKSUM too) and the version for path matching stored in
	DDRBIN_VERS variable. Do so in your .bbappend with:

		DDRBIN_VERS:my-machine = "v2.07"

	If somehow the filename differs from the one provided in this layer, you
	can override it from your bbappend with the DDRBIN_FILE variable:

		DDRBIN_VERS:my-machine = "v2.07"
		DDRBIN_FILE:my-machine = "rk3308_ddr_451MHz_uart4_m0_${DDRBIN_VERS}.bin"

	If you wish to use a configuration for the DDR binary blob provided in
	rockchip-rkbin-ddr recipe that differs from the default, you can set the
	RKBIN_DDR_RECONFIGURE variable to 1 for your machine, e.g.:

		RKBIN_DDR_RECONFIGURE:my-machine = "1"

	You will need to provide your custom ddrbin_param.txt via your bbappend, e.g.
	your ddrbin_param in
	meta-my-layer/recipes-bsp/rkbin/rockchip-rkbin-ddr/my-machine/ddrbin_param.txt
	and a bbappend, e.g. in meta-my-layer/recipes-bsp/rkbin/rockchip-rkbin-ddr_git.bbappend,
	which contains:

		FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"

	As for the content of ddrbin_param.txt,
	https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkbin/blob/master/tools/ddrbin_tool_user_guide.txt
	may help.

  rk3308 rkbin:
	The latest ddr initializer for the rk3308 platform does not output
	diagnostic messages to uart0. This causes a bunch of gibberish to
	be printed to the console window which only becomes legible once
	the linux kernel starts. I.e. the console output of the ddr
	initialization routine, as well as u-boot is lost. An older
	version of this same binary blob does, however, support output to
	uart0 (making its diagnostic messages as well as u-boot available
	on the console). By default the build assumes the user would like
	to see these message and be able to have the option to interact
	with u-boot.

	IOW: for rk3308-based devices, an older version of rkbin is used.

	If, however, the user would prefer to use the latest binary ddr
	initializer from rkbin, simply set:

		RKBIN_RK3308_LATEST = "1"
	
	in the configuration (e.g. conf/local.conf).

  wic compression:
	For boards which build and boot wic images, the user can optionally specify
	a compression using the WIC_COMPRESSION_EXTENSION variable. By default "wic"
	images are built, but if the user would prefer, say "wic.xz" images, simply
	specify:

		WIC_COMPRESSION_EXTENSION = ".xz"

	in the configuration (e.g. conf/local.conf).

  A/B updates with RAUC
	This layer now contains one example of building an A/B update using RAUC.
	Users are free to use/test this example, to optionally enable it, to build
	their own update strategies based on this one, or to ignore it completely.
	This example only works with

		INIT_MANAGER = "systemd"

	If you wish to use this example in your builds:
	- enable 'systemd' as your init system
	- add the meta-rauc layer to your build (with the corresponding branch)
	- add 'rauc' to your DISTRO_FEATURES
	- enable RK_RAUC_DEMO in your config

	If you wish to implement your own RAUC update without using the example from
	this layer, perform the same steps as above except for the step enabling
	RK_RAUC_DEMO.

  /data overlay with RAUC
	When using RAUC for whole-partition rootfs updates, you will need some
	way of preserving some pieces of data between updates; this is why the
	DEMO scheme provided in this layer also includes a /data partition.
	Now that you have a /data partition that is not updated, you need some
	way of storing your important data there and making it available,
	seamlessly, into your system regardless of which slot is running.

	One way of accomplishing this is to move your important files into
	/data and providing symlinks back into each running bundle. But that
	requires you to know ahead of time which files will be touched... which
	quickly can become a game of whack-a-mole. A better alternative is to
	use a filesystem overlay. With a filesystem overlay, multiple paths are
	overlaid on top of each other behind the scenes so what you see is one
	directory containing the aggregation of all layers. Filesystem overlays
	have a concept of "bottom layers" and "upper layers", if you write a new
	file into an overlay, the file will be written into the uppermost
	layer, leaving the lower layers intact. If a file is modified, the
	modifications are stored in the upper layer, occluding the lower layer.
	Therefore, creating an overlay using locations in the /data partition
	as the uppermost layer allows changes to persist across RAUC updates.

	This layer includes a simple overlay scheme to demonstrate one way of
	making use of this mechanism. To enable the demo included in this layer
	RAUC must be enabled, then also enable:

		RK_OVERLAY_DEMO

	This demo includes overlays for both the /etc and /home directories.
	With these overlays in place, you can change a user's password, or add
	new users, and those changes will be available in subsequent updates.
	By default bitbake places the root user's home directory in /home/root,
	but systemd moves this to /root. The location of the root user's home
	directory is stored in the

		ROOT_HOME

	variable. If you would like to use the overlay example provided in this
	layer and also overlay the root user's home directory, simply define
	this variable in your build to place the root user's home directory
	under /home.

	This feature requires overlay support to be enabled in the Linux
	kernel. Specifically the following kernel config option must be either
	=m or =y. By default this layer will use the in-kernel defconfig as a
	base, which includes this option as a module, and kernel modules are
	installed by default.

		CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS

  HW video decoding with gstreamer

	Most Rockchip SoCs have some integrated VPU, either Hantro, RKVDEC or
	RKVDECv2. Those are called stateless VPUs and they require tools to be
	adapted so they can be used. Upstream ffmpeg doesn't support them (yet)
	but gstreamer does, via the v4l2sl* plugins. However, by default those
	aren't built in OE-Core. This layer enables these plugins by default for
	all SoCs that have at least one VPU (at the time of writing, all SoCs
	supported by this layer to the exception of RK3308).

	If you wish to NOT build those plugins anymore, you can set

		ENABLE_STATELESS_VPU_GST = "0"

	in any appropriate conf file (or in a
	gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad_%.bbappend in your own layer).

	Note that this is only relevant for upstream-based Linux kernels as
	Rockchip have developed their own ABI for their own kernel that isn't
	compatible (see Rockchip Media Process Platform (MPP) and
	downstream gstreamer-rockchip plugin for those kernels).

  RK_KERNEL_FITIMAGE

	When generating an image, the BSP code needs to know whether or not to
	package the kernel pieces as a fitImage or not. By default it is assumed
	most MACHINEs will use the fitImage format. Otherwise disable the
	RK_KERNEL_FITIMAGE variable boolean to indicate otherwise.

	NOTE: this variable must be set before any include/require in the
	      machine configuration file

U-Boot Environment:
------------------
	In order to configure U-Boot to be able to store its environment into the
	device from which it was booted, for any device supported in this BSP,
	simply add the following to MACHINE_FEATURES:

		rk-u-boot-env

	If enabled, to additionally have the U-Boot environment generated and
	stored in the image, also enable the following variable (default: off):

		RK_IMAGE_INCLUDES_UBOOT_ENV

	The script:

		scripts/dump-uboot-env-from-yocto-image.sh

	can be used on a rockchip wic image to see the contents of the U-Boot
	environment partition at build time.
