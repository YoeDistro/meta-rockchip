This README file contains information on building with the meta-rockchip BSP
layer.

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  {
  	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
	branch: <the same release used for meta-rockchip>

  	AND

  	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
  	layers: meta
	branch: <the same release used for meta-rockchip>
  }

I. Configure yocto/oe environment
=================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding tools described in the "Dependencies"
section. Be sure that everything is in the same directory.

	$ mkdir yocto; cd yocto
	~/yocto $ git clone git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
	~/yocto $ git clone git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
	~/yocto $ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-rockchip

Then you need to source the configuration script:

	~/yocto $ source openembedded-core/oe-init-build-env build bitbake

Having done that, you can build an image for a rockchip board by adding the
location of the meta-rockchip layer to bblayers.conf, along with any other
layers needed (to access common metadata shared between BSPs)

To enable the build for a specific board, add its name in the MACHINE variable
to local.conf:

	MACHINE ?= "radxarock"

All supported machines can be found in meta-rockchip/conf/machine.

You should then be able to build a image as such:

	~/yocto/build $ bitbake core-image-minimal

At the end of a successful build, you should have an image in

	tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/<IMAGE_NAME>
